<p class="well-note">Growth doesn't happen all at once, it's okay to move at your own pace. College can be defeating, but struggling doesn't mean you're failing. Give yourself grace to take breaks, be patient with yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out for support. Your productivity does not define your worth.</p>
