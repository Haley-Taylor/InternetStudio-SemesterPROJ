    <h3>The Four Main Food Groups</h3>
    <p>Consuming foods from all four groups daily ensures your body stays energized, has essential nutrients, and is supported for overall health.</p>

<div class="groups">
  <div class="grid-item-bold">Four Componets</div>
  <div class="grid-item-bold">Benefits</div>
  <div class="grid-item-bold">Examples</div>

  <div class="grid-item">Carbohydrates</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Your body's main source of energy, it fuels your brain and gives you power for activities</div>

<p class="dis">A balanced diet looks different for everyone. It is unlikely you will consume all four food groups at once. A good goal is to strive to get most of the groups on your plate at mealtime. It is important you stay consistent rather than strive to be perfect.</p>
